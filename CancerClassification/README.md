# Project Title: Cancer Classification Using Gene Expression

## Objective
To build a machine learning model to detect cancer presence based on gene expression levels of two genes.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle (Genomic Data for Cancer)
- Features: Gene One, Gene Two
- Label: Cancer Present (1/0)

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Models Applied
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machine
- Neural Network

## Results
- Best Model: SVM (94.5% accuracy)
- ROC-AUC Score: 0.98

## Ethical Considerations
- Data bias
- Accuracy risks in medical predictions
